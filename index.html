                    Lorem is a tool which can be used to manage events. Events can be created, managed and deleted by
                    administrators. Normal users can sign up for events and rate them upon completion. The
                    administrator's
                    panel is written in Java and the user's page is written in C#. You can view a demo by clicking on
                    the
                    video, please note that it is in Dutch, but there are English subtitles.

                    Cllct is a bookmarking tool which you can use to collect links to websites. Links can be sorted into
                    categories and given a name and a color. It is also possible to search for links and there is a dark
                    mode. I created this tool because I was unsatisfied with the bookmark management options in Chrome.
                    The bookmarks would often fall out of sync with each other on different computers and it was not
                    accessable from a computer where sync was not turned on (such as a friends computer). It is written
                    in C#.

            <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
            <p>In the future I hope to focus on back-end programming. I am interested in exploring the
                possibilities offered by technologies such as GraphQL and PHP frameworks like Drupal. I would also like
                to learn more about low-level programming with languages like Rust and C, in this domain I would like to
                design and implement some small linux utilities in the vein of ripgrep and gotop.</p>
